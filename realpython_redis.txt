redis-cli simple command:
PING

- Redis stands for Remote Dictionary Service
- A Redis database holds key:value pairs and supports commands such as GET, SET, and DEL, as well as several hundred additional commands. (https://redis.io/commands)
- Redis keys are always strings
- Redis values may be a number of different data types. Weâ€™ll cover some of the more essential value data types in this tutorial: string, list, hashes, and sets. Some advanced types include geospatial items and the new stream type
- Many Redis commands operate in constant O(1) time, just like retrieving a value from a Python dict or any hash table.
- The Python Redis client library, redis-py does things differently. It encapsulates an actual TCP connection to a Redis server and sends raw commands, as bytes serialized using the REdis Serialization Protocol (RESP), to the server. It then takes the raw reply and parses it back into a Python object such as bytes, int, or even datetime.datetime.
